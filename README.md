This code is the result of experimenting with Haskell's unboxed/unlifted types in order to maximise the raw performance by avoiding allocations as much as possible.

The code was originally put into a gist ([https://gist.github.com/Mesabloo/96aef8da87903201ee76edd6c909c2ff](https://gist.github.com/Mesabloo/96aef8da87903201ee76edd6c909c2ff)) but has been migrated here and somehow broken also.

The goal is to implement a minimalistic virtual machine (VM) to run a very small subset of the [Noc language](https://github.com/noc-lang).
Low performance is an issue.

Here are the last known performance results on my machine:

| `fact(15)` | `ack(3,6)` | `fib(28)` |
| :--------: | :--------: | :-------: |
|   ~4Âµs   |   ~28ms   |  ~96ms  |

Note that this is meant to be 100% Haskell code.
Github detects some C code from a `.h` file which is meant only to use some constants across multiple modules.
If you read it, you will even find that this is not valid C code.

:warning: This is very experimental.
Expect to see some weird and ugly very unsafe Haskell code, relying on GHC's own internal libraries and boot packages (and nothing else).
I am proud of what I have been able to do, though I would not recommend anybody doing this at all.
